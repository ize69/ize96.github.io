my personal and professional portfolio

a project is uploaded as a png or jpeg in the format projectName_0.png
each image of a project will have a difrent number on the end off the file name 

if a discription is wanted for the project it can be added as the as a txt file in the format of
projectName.txt

projects that share a connection or a theme should be stored in set projects with a parent folder with that name
